First of all, I was flattered that my voice sounds soft but commanding, but that's beside the point. I just don't know why the outfit I chose to wear today should be relevant. Anyway, when he asked if I had a boyfriend I knew he wasn't concentrating on my call so I hung up on him. So I'm calling now, after hours, on my own time. Is it possible to tell us where our paper is without me revealing the color clothing I have on right now?"
